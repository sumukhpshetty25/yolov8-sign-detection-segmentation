This project is a real-time web application that uses YOLOv8 for two powerful computer vision tasks: **Sign Language Gesture Detection** and **Human Body Segmentation**. Built using Python and Flask, the system captures live webcam footage and applies trained deep learning models for interactive detection and segmentation.

## 🔍 Features

- **Real-Time Sign Detection**  
  Detects and classifies sign language gestures from a live webcam feed using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.

- **Live Body Segmentation**  
  Uses YOLOv8 segmentation capabilities to outline and segment the full human body in real time.

- **Web-Based Interface**  
  Simple, interactive Flask frontend to view results and switch between modes (`sign` or `segmentation`).

- **Toggle Modes**  
  Easily switch between sign detection and segmentation by changing the route or query parameter.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Flask**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**
- **HTML/CSS (Jinja templates)**
